# Ansible Role: MySQL

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/ansible-role-mysql.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/ansible-role-mysql)

Installs MySQL/Mariadb server on RHEL/CentOS or Debian/Ubuntu servers.

## Requirements
No special requirements; note that this role requires root access, so either run it in a playbook with a global `become: true`, or invoke the role in your playbook like:

    - hosts: database
      roles:
        - role: ansible-role-mysql
          become: true


## Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with default values (see `defaults/main.yml`):

```
    mysql_user_home: /root
    mysql_user_name: root
    mysql_user_password: root
```
The home directory inside which Python MySQL settings will be stored, which Ansible will use when connecting to MySQL. This should be the home directory of the user which runs this Ansible role.

    mysql_root_password: root

The MySQL root user account password.

    mysql_enabled_on_startup: yes

Whether MySQL should be enabled on startup.

    mysql_databases: []

The MySQL databases to create. A database has the values `name`, `encoding` (defaults to `utf8`), `collation` (defaults to `utf8_general_ci`) and `replicate` (defaults to `1`, only used if replication is configured). The formats of these are the same as in the `mysql_db` module.

    mysql_users: []

The MySQL users and their privileges. A user has the values `name`, `host` (defaults to `localhost`), `password` and `priv` (defaults to `*.*:USAGE`). The formats of these are the same as in the `mysql_user` module.

You can also supply a hashed password for the user (generated by  SELECT PASSWORD('mypass');)
If you do then set the 'encrypted: True' is set for the user.


    mysql_packages:
      - mysql
      - mysql-server
      - MySQL-python

(OS-specific, RedHat/CentOS defaults listed here) Packages to be installed. In some situations, you may need to add additional packages, like `mysql-devel`.

    mysql_enablerepo: ""

(RedHat/CentOS only) If you have enabled any additional repositories (might I suggest geerlingguy.repo-epel or geerlingguy.repo-remi), those repositories can be listed under this variable (e.g. `remi,epel`). This can be handy, as an example, if you want to install later versions of MySQL.

    mysql_port: "3306"
    mysql_bind_address: '0.0.0.0'
    mysql_datadir: /var/lib/mysql

Default MySQL connection configuration.

    mysql_log_error: /var/log/mysqld.log
    mysql_syslog_tag: mysqld

MySQL logging configuration. Setting `mysql_log_error` to `syslog` will make MySQL log to syslog using the `mysql_syslog_tag`.

    mysql_key_buffer_size: "256M"
    mysql_max_allowed_packet: "64M"
    mysql_table_open_cache: "256"
    [...]

The rest of the settings in `defaults/main.yml` control MySQL's memory usage. The default values are tuned for a server where MySQL can consume ~512 MB RAM, so you should consider adjusting them to suit your particular server better.

    mysql_server_id: "1"
    mysql_max_binlog_size: "100M"
    mysql_expire_logs_days: "10"
    mysql_replication_role: master
    mysql_replication_master: ''
    mysql_replication_user: []

Replication settings. Set `mysql_server_id` and `mysql_replication_role` by server (e.g. the master would be ID `1`, with the `mysql_replication_role` of `master`, and the slave would be ID `2`, with the `mysql_replication_role` of `slave`). The `mysql_replication_user` uses the same keys as `mysql_users`, and is created on master servers, and used to replicate on all the slaves.

## Performance
There are a number of settings that affect performance

### Transaction Isolation
mysql_transaction_isolation: 'READ-COMMITTED'
The default is REPEATABLE-READ but this affects performamce and is rarely needed
READ-COMMITTED is recommended for most installations

### Autoincrement id
When autoincrement ids are set on bulk inserts the table can be locked
It is better to have the ids obtained individually especially when it can't be known
how nmany records are inserted
the default is 1
mysql_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode: '2'
https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/auto_increment-handling-in-innodb/

Both of the above can cause issues with statement based binlogs (the default)
https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/binary-log-formats/
So if you set the above then also set the binlog format to ROW
mysql_binlog_format: 'ROW'
So a good performance setting would be:
mysql_transaction_isolation: 'READ-COMMITTED'
mysql_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode: '2'
mysql_binlog_format: 'ROW'
Which would set the following in the my.cnf (not in this order as other settings are made too)
```
[mysqld]
innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=2
binlog_format=row
transaction-isolation=READ-COMMITTED
```
Note that last setting actually sets the variable tx_isolation
This often casues confusion

## Encryption at rest
This sets up database encryption

## Secure TLS communication
This sets up certificates for SSL/TLS communication with clients
Turn on this setup with

```
mysql_tls_setup: true
```
Takes the following vars

```
# on | off
mysql_tls_state: off  <-- turn on or off  ssl in the db
mysql_tls_path: '/etc/mysql/ssl'
mysql_tls_server_config_file:
   - {name: '55-server-tls.cnf', path: '/etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d'}
mysql_tls_client_config_file:
   - {name: '55-clients-tls.cnf', path: '/etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d'}
```

Whether to generate the certificates on the server
False means you will provide your own (useful for clusters)
```
mysql_tls_generate_certs: true
```

If generating your own then you need a prexix for the certs
This will prexis the CA, Server and client certificates and keys

```
mysql_tls_cert_prefix: mysqldb
```

If providing your own then provide a list of at least the following:
Note the file name should be the full path to the source file

```
mysql_tls_cert_files:
  - name: 'mysqldbdb-cert.pem'                          <-- the ssl-ca
    src:  '{{ inventory_dir }}/common/files/ssl/DB-TLS'
  - name: 'mysqldbdbserver-cert.pem'                    <-- the ssl server cert
    src:  '{{ inventory_dir }}/common/files/ssl/DB-TLS'
  - name: 'mysqldbdbserver-key.pem'                     <-- the ssl server key
    src: '{{ inventory_dir }}/common/files/ssl/DB-TLS'

```
and possibly the client files
```
 - name: 'mysqldbdbclient-cert.pem'                     <-- the ssl client cert
    src: '{{ inventory_dir }}/common/files/ssl/DB-TLS'
  - name: 'mysqldbdbclient-key.pem'                     <-- the ssl client key
    src: '{{ inventory_dir }}/common/files/ssl/DB-TLS'

```
## Dependencies
