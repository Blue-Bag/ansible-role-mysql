# Ansible Role: MySQL

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/ansible-role-mysql.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/ansible-role-mysql)

Installs MySQL server on RHEL/CentOS or Debian/Ubuntu servers.

## Requirements

None.

## Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with default values (see `vars/main.yml`):

    mysql_user_home: /root

The home directory inside which Python MySQL settings will be stored, which Ansible will use when connecting to MySQL. This should be the home directory of the user which runs this Ansible role.

    mysql_root_password: root

The MySQL root user account password.

    mysql_enabled_on_startup: yes

Whether MySQL should be enabled on startup.

    mysql_databases: []

The MySQL databases to create. A database has the values `name`, `encoding` (defaults to `utf8`), `collation` (defaults to `utf8_general_ci`) and `replicate` (defaults to `1`, only used if replication is configured). The formats of these are the same as in the `mysql_db` module.

    mysql_users: []

The MySQL users and their privileges. A user has the values `name`, `host` (defaults to `localhost`), `password` and `priv` (defaults to `*.*:USAGE`). The formats of these are the same as in the `mysql_user` module.

You can also supply a hashed password for the user (generated by  SELECT PASSWORD('mypass');)
If you do then set the 'encrypted: True' is set for the user.


    mysql_packages:
      - mysql
      - mysql-server
      - MySQL-python

(OS-specific, RedHat/CentOS defaults listed here) Packages to be installed. In some situations, you may need to add additional packages, like `mysql-devel`.

    mysql_enablerepo: ""

(RedHat/CentOS only) If you have enabled any additional repositories (might I suggest geerlingguy.repo-epel or geerlingguy.repo-remi), those repositories can be listed under this variable (e.g. `remi,epel`). This can be handy, as an example, if you want to install later versions of MySQL.

    mysql_port: "3306"
    mysql_bind_address: '0.0.0.0'
    mysql_datadir: /var/lib/mysql

Default MySQL connection configuration.

    mysql_log_error: /var/log/mysqld.log
    mysql_syslog_tag: mysqld

MySQL logging configuration. Setting `mysql_log_error` to `syslog` will make MySQL log to syslog using the `mysql_syslog_tag`.

    mysql_key_buffer_size: "256M"
    mysql_max_allowed_packet: "64M"
    mysql_table_open_cache: "256"
    [...]

The rest of the settings in `defaults/main.yml` control MySQL's memory usage. The default values are tuned for a server where MySQL can consume ~512 MB RAM, so you should consider adjusting them to suit your particular server better.

    mysql_server_id: "1"
    mysql_max_binlog_size: "100M"
    mysql_expire_logs_days: "10"
    mysql_replication_role: master
    mysql_replication_master: ''
    mysql_replication_user: []

Replication settings. Set `mysql_server_id` and `mysql_replication_role` by server (e.g. the master would be ID `1`, with the `mysql_replication_role` of `master`, and the slave would be ID `2`, with the `mysql_replication_role` of `slave`). The `mysql_replication_user` uses the same keys as `mysql_users`, and is created on master servers, and used to replicate on all the slaves.

## Performance
There are a number of settings that affect performance

### Transaction Isolation
mysql_transaction_isolation: 'READ-COMMITTED'
The default is REPEATABLE-READ but this affects performamce and is rarely needed
READ-COMMITTED is recommended for most installations

### Autoincrement id
When autoincrement ids are set on bulk inserts the table can be locked
It is better to have the ids obtained individually especially when it can't be known
how nmany records are inserted
the default is 1
mysql_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode: '2'
https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/auto_increment-handling-in-innodb/

Both of the above can cause issues with statement based binlogs (the default)
https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/binary-log-formats/
So if you set the above then also set the binlog format to ROW
mysql_binlog_format: 'ROW'
So a good performance setting would be:
mysql_transaction_isolation: 'READ-COMMITTED'
mysql_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode: '2'
mysql_binlog_format: 'ROW'
Which would set the following in the my.cnf (not in this order as other settings are made too)
```
[mysqld]
innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=2
binlog_format=row
transaction-isolation=READ-COMMITTED
```
Note that last seeting actually sets the variable tx_isolation
This ofetn casues confusion

## Dependencies

None.

## Example Playbook

    - hosts: db-servers
      vars_files:
        - vars/main.yml
      roles:
        - { role: geerlingguy.mysql }

*Inside `vars/main.yml`*:

    mysql_root_password: super-secure-password
    mysql_databases:
      - name: example_db
        encoding: latin1
        collation: latin1_general_ci
    mysql_users:
      - name: example_user
        host: "%"
        password: similarly-secure-password
        priv: "example_db.*:ALL"
